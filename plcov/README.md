## plcov
### Description
*plcov* is a testing tool developed in SWI-Prolog that measures the coverage of a prolog program. This tool innovates over existing applications by using a code instrumentation technique instead of interpreter internals, making the tool independent of any specific interpreter and portable to any ISO compliant implementation.
### Context
This tool was developed as part of a bachelor's thesis for my computer science degree at the Polytechnic University of Valencia. The project was presented within the specialization of software development, although it also explores some aspects of computer theory. The thesis recieved a final score of outstanding (10).
### Repository
The root folder of the repository contains a PDF version of the bachelor's thesis, along with a folder named *code* with the code for the project.
