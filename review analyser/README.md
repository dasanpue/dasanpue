## trend predictor
### Description
This project is designed to predict an amazon review star rating (1 to 5) given the review text, it uses out-of-the box sentiment analysers combined with different machine learning methods to obtain more accurate results. It also incorporates different tools, like a custom built sentiment analyser trained on amazon reviews and product metadata, to obtain higher accuracies.

This project is written as an python notebook and uses SciKit-Learn libraries to compute and combine the different predictors. In order to speed the calculation the project uses the hardware GPU acceleration built into SciKit-Learn.
### Context
This tool was developed as a final project for the Applied Machine Learning course in the University of Pennsylvania. It was developed over the course of 3 weeks with 2 other students: Michael R. and Hugo G.. The project recieved a final score of A.
### Repository
The root folder of the repository contains a PDF with the final report, along with an ipynb file that holds all the code for the project.
