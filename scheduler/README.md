### Description
This tool was developed to solve and existing problem in the faculty of business administration at the Polytechnic University of Valencia. Once students have handed in their bachelor thesis they must be assigned a presentation date and tribunal that will evaluate the work, this presentation date and tribunal must comply with a series of restrictions (for example, the professor that tutor's the thesis cannot be a part of the tribunal) and a series of optimizations (for example, tribunals prefer the presentations to be condensed in a day instead of spaced out). Finding a solution by hand quickly becomes infeasable as hundreds of students must be assigned a presentation time in the space of a few days.
The tool uses 2 distinct optimization processes in order to find a feasible result, these optimizations are written out as minizinc constraints and solved with different solvers offered in the minizinc package.
### Context
This tool was developed as part of a bachelor's thesis for my business administration degree at the Polytechnic University of Valencia. The project was presented within the specialization of operations management, and describes the problem both through a theorical and practical perspective, detailing it's applications in business settings. The thesis recieved a final score of outstanding (10).
### Repository
The root folder of the repository contains a PDF version of the bachelor's thesis, along with a folder named *code* with the code for the project, consisting of 2 separate minizinc files along with 2 data files containing the data for an example run.
